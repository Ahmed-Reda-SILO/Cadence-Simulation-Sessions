# Cadence Simulation Sessions

Course-style tutorial materials for **Analog IC Design using Cadence Virtuoso**, covering the complete design flow from **schematic design** to **layout verification** and **post-layout simulation**.

This repository is suitable for **VLSI / Analog IC design courses**, labs, and self-study.

## 📚 Course Overview

The sessions demonstrate the **end-to-end CMOS IC design flow** using a CMOS inverter as a running example:

1. **Schematic Design & Simulation**
2. **Layout Design, DRC & LVS**
3. **Post-Layout Simulation & Parasitic Analysis**
